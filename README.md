#### Homework Assignments ðŸ“‘

The following homework assignments, along with the solutions provided by the teaching assistants, are uploaded to this repository and are available for reference. All exercises are written in LaTeX format.

#### Homework 1
- In this exercise, basic concepts related to Linear Control Systems are covered. The topics include practical aspects such as Laplace Transform, modeling, block diagrams, and Masonâ€™s rule.

#### Homework 2
- This exercise explores the analysis of the closed-loop system response with unit feedback. It also includes examining the transfer function of various systems and analyzing time-domain response characteristics such as steady-state error and others.

#### Homework 3
- This assignment focuses on more applied topics. The main questions revolve around the geometric location of the roots. The primary focus of this exercise is on the root locus and the design of basic, simple controllers.

#### Homework 4
- The questions in this exercise are centered around analytical topics related to the Nyquist criterion and Bode plots. The exercise primarily involves analysis: ensuring that the conditions specified in the problem are met and analyzing the given transfer functions.

#### Homework 5
- This assignment emphasizes topics related to gain margin and phase margin. The questions explore the related concepts and their analysis in control systems.

#### Homework 6
- This exercise contains design-related questions and requires a strong command of nearly all topics from the Linear Control Systems course to answer the questions effectively.

All the code used in the solutions for these exercises is included within the exercise files.
